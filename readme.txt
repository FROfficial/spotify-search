I would run this in using terminal in visual studio code.
  run:
    node server.js
  in the spotify-search folder.
This project creates a simple search application with the use of Spotify API. I spent time trying to learn authentication in Spotify as well as the search API.
Also experimenting with some new bootstrap stuff that I thought I could work with in the future.
